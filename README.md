# 💼 Salary Prediction using Ensemble Learning

Welcome to the **Salary Prediction** project — an IBM PBL initiative that leverages **Ensemble Learning** (Random Forest) to predict salaries based on your profile!

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to build a robust machine learning model that predicts expected salary using important features like:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Education Level  
- Job Title  
- Years of Experience  

The app is built with **Streamlit**, providing a simple and interactive UI for instant predictions.

## ⚙️ Features

- Handles categorical variables using **OneHotEncoding**  
- Uses **Random Forest Regressor** (Ensemble Learning) for accurate predictions  
- Interactive **dropdowns** and **input fields** in the web app  
- Instant display of predicted salary
